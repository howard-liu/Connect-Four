# Connect-Four
Connect Four game

## How to play
Use `python3 Game.py` in terminal to play. Selecting using 'p' or 'b' for player or bot for player 1 and 2. For a player's turn, enter number 1-7 for where to drop your piece. If a connect four happens, winner is declared and game ends.

## Bot
Currently the bot just uses a random column every time. It can be expanded to take in the board state to make smart decision making. I'll work on that when I want to explore the strategy of Connect Four.

Happy playing!
